Hi, I'm Marzuki. I used to be an engineer, now turning data scientist. They say skills are transferrable and I believe that. I would say I'm a multipotentialite (aka Generalist). I used to believe that I haven't found my true calling yet, well I'm still do.

I created this website to keep track of past, present and future. Who knows what I'm into in the future.
