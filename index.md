Hi, I'm Marzuki. I used to be an engineer, now turning data scientist. They say skills are transferrable and I believe that. I would say I'm a [multipotentialite](https://puttylike.com/terminology/) that haven't found my true calling yet (_**working on that**_).

I created this website to keep track of all the things I've done in the past, present and future. Who knows what I'm into in the future.
